	 If the optional timeout parameter is given, blocking operations (like 
	 connection attempts) will timeout after that many seconds (if it is 
	 not given, the global default timeout setting is used). 
	 The optional blocksize parameter sets the buffer size in bytes for sending a file-like message body.

	This will send a request to the server using the HTTP request method method and the request URI url. The provided url must be an absolute path to conform with RFC 2616 ยง5.1.2 (unless connecting to an HTTP proxy server or using the OPTIONS or CONNECT methods).

	If body is specified, the specified data is sent after the headers are finished. It may be a str, a bytes-like object, an open file object, or an iterable of bytes. If body is a string, it is encoded as ISO-8859-1, the default for HTTP. If it is a bytes-like object, the bytes are sent as is. If it is a file object, the contents of the file is sent; this file object should support at least the read() method. If the file object is an instance of io.TextIOBase, the data returned by the read() method will be encoded as ISO-8859-1, otherwise the data returned by read() is sent as is. If body is an iterable, the elements of the iterable are sent as is until the iterable is exhausted.

	The headers argument should be a mapping of extra HTTP headers to send with the request. A Host header must be provided to conform with RFC 2616 ยง5.1.2 (unless connecting to an HTTP proxy server or using the OPTIONS or CONNECT methods).

	If headers contains neither Content-Length nor Transfer-Encoding, but there is a request body, one of those header fields will be added automatically. If body is None, the Content-Length header is set to 0 for methods that expect a body (PUT, POST, and PATCH). If body is a string or a bytes-like object that is not also a file, the Content-Length header is set to its length. Any other type of body (files and iterables in general) will be chunk-encoded, and the Transfer-Encoding header will automatically be set instead of Content-Length.

	The encode_chunked argument is only relevant if Transfer-Encoding is specified in headers. If encode_chunked is False, the HTTPConnection object assumes that all encoding is handled by the calling code. If it is True, the body will be chunk-encoded.
